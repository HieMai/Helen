                                <p> Words excite me. Data lights me up. Challenges bring out the absolute best in me. This is the holy trinity of what I am made of both professionally and personally. I am a PhD candidate nearing the end of my academic journey. My expertise lies in digital communication, and especially on what constitutes successful digital communication. I am motivated to put my expertise into practice at Helen as a Sustainability Communications Trainee.

                                <p>Through my years in the academia, I have gained both expertise knowledge on communication and essential working life skills. I am nearly done with my PhD in linguistics. My focus has been on interaction and digital communication. Some of the key areas of my expertise have to do with the role of prompts, images, and videos in successful digital communication. Additionally, I am confident in my project management skills, as my dissertation has proceeded on schedule through challenging times. I have learned to write on complex topics both for expert and layman audiences. With this, I have gained a skill of comprehending quickly what is essential from texts, visualizations, and tables. I have also developed resilience that carries me through stressful situations.</p>

                                <p>While my roots lie in communication, my branches stretch far and wide. I have picked up programming as a form of relaxation. I am quite comfortable with HTML and CSS but have also some skills in Python (I‚Äôm getting into pandas). More important than these skills, is my ability to self-learn. To make the most of my expertise in communication, I have also begun a journey into marketing. Currently I am working on some courses on Udemy, after the completion of which I will have a basic understanding of SEO and web analytics. I am also getting familiar with the basics of marketing. I bring a diverse skill set to the table and come equipped with an analytical mind. In other words, I have a comprehensive set of well-established skills and practices, and I am currently working on expanding that set.  </p>

                                <p>I am a mix of a creative thinker with strong logical skills. I am not afraid to think outside the box and I am confident in what I do. My ability to take perspective, maintain a positive attitude in challenging situations, and to deliver exceptional results under pressure are among my core strengths. I am empathetic, which makes teamwork a breeze for me. Whether it's tackling complex tasks or finding solace in programming, gardening, or baking, I am happiest when there is a balance between pushing the boundaries of my skills and enforcing what I already know well. I am yet to meet a challenge that I have not learned anything from. Therefore, I encounter even the trickiest of situations with a solution-oriented mindset. My attention to detail and commitment to constant self-improvement define my approach to everything I embark on.  </p>
